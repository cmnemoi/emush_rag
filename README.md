A RAG-based API to answer questions about [eMush](https:/emush.eternaltwin.org/) using curated data.

Stack: 
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the API, [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for automated testing ;
- [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) for the vector database allowing document retrieval ;
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) for automated deployment via a CI/CD pipeline on a self-managed [Digital Ocean server](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) : https://askneron.com/docs
