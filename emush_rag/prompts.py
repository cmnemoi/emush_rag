REFORMULATION_PROMPT = """Rephrase the user's last message into a self-contained, clear, and contextually appropriate question or response. Use the following rules to guide the reformulation:
- If the user's message is a follow-up within the same conversation, reformulate it into a clear and direct question that incorporates the relevant context from the previous exchanges.
- If the user's message shifts to a new topic, reformulate it as an independent question, ignoring the prior conversation.
- If the user's message is conversational closure or small talk (e.g. greetings, thanks, etc.), do not reformulate it.
